 <h1 className="text-2xl"> The values and principles of the UK</h1> <br />
              <p>
              British society is founded on fundamental values and principles which all 
            those living in the UK should respect and support. These values are reflected 
            in the responsibilities, rights and privileges of being a British citizen or
            permanent resident of the UK. They are based on history and traditions and are 
            protected by law, customs and expectations. There is no place in British society
              for extremism or intolerance.
              </p> <br />
         <ul>
            <h1 className="text-2xl"> The fundamental principles of British life include</h1> <br />
            <li> Democracy</li> <br />
            <li> Democracy</li> <br />
            <li> Individual liberty</li> <br />
            <li> Individual liberty</li> <br />
            <li>Participation in community life.</li>
          </ul> <br />

          <p>
          As part of the citizenship ceremony, new citizens pledge to uphold these values. The pledge is:

            ‘I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen.’

            Flowing from the fundamental principles are responsibilities and freedoms which are shared by all those living in the UK and which we expect all residents to respect.
